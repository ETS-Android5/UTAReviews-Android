This is our repositor for Team 10 in CSE 3311-002 Spring 2022 for Christoph Csallner

Vision Statement:
    To help nourish quality education among current and future students at the University of Texas at Arlington through open student and teacher discussions. We want to be successful in helping students avoid situations that can lead to stress, depression, and failure through poor choices of professors or class combinations while giving professors a medium to communicate and take feedback from reviewers.
